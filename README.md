# Lottery

A blockchain-based lottery system implemented using Solidity smart contracts and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

- `contracts/`: Contains Solidity smart contract(s) for the lottery system
- `test/`: Includes test scripts to verify contract functionality
- `scripts/`: Scripts for compiling and deploying the smart contracts

## Purpose

This project serves as a practice exercise for:

1. Writing smart contracts in Solidity for the Ethereum blockchain
2. Implementing test-driven development using the `assert` module in JavaScript

## Technologies Used

- Solidity: For writing smart contracts
- JavaScript: For testing, deployment, and possibly frontend interaction
